# CNN basic implementation

Keras library is used to provide Sequential layers of Convolution, Max Pool, LeakyRelu followed by Dense.
Dataset used is fashion-mnist. It is present in keras.datasets.

 

## Getting Started

[Chris Olah](http://colah.github.io/). This is a good read up for understanding CNNs.

### Prerequisites

get numpy, matplotlib, keras installed.

[Keras](https://keras.io/) Keras docs can be followed along for installation (including dependencies) followed with examples.

## Running the file

Once installation are done with, file <cnnTrial.py> can be run with <python3 cnnTrial.py> after you would go in your current directory. For the same, Python 3.5.2


### IDE used

Jupyter Notebook 5.4.1
[set up jupyter notebook](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-jupyter-notebook-to-run-ipython-on-ubuntu-16-04)

Preferable since piecewise code can be run.
